# TypeScript

## What is TypeScript

TypeScript is a programming language that builds on JavaScript by adding static typing. Static typing means you can explicitly specify the types of variables, function arguments, return values, and more. Unlike dynamic typing, where types are determined at runtime, static typing allows TypeScript to catch type-related errors early during development, improving code quality and reducing bugs.

## Commonly Used Type Annotations

- string: Represents text values.

- number: Represents numeric values (both integers and floating-point numbers).

- boolean: Represents a value that is either true or false.

- any: A fallback type that allows any value to be assigned to a variable, disabling type checking.

- void: Typically used for functions that do not return a value.

- null and undefined: Used to represent the absence of a value.
